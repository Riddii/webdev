1. Introduction: 
The Result Management System has been developed to manage storage, retrieval, and display of  student results in a quick and systematic way. The system enables uploading student result  information through an Excel file and has the facility of retrieving and showing results through  inputting a student ID. The system also enables the student to download a result as a PDF format  for ease of access and forwarding. 

2. Objective: 
To create a simple-to-use platform for handling student results. 
To facilitate bulk uploading of student results from an Excel sheet. 
To offer a simple-to-use interface for faculty and students to use the system. To enable students to view their personal results and download them as a PDF. 

3. Technology Stack: 
Frontend: HTML, CSS, PHP 
Backend: PHP, MySQL 
Excel Processing: PhpSpreadsheet library 
File Handling: PHP for file upload and PDF generation 
Database: MySQL for storing student results 

4. Features: 
Excel Upload: Teachers can upload student results in Excel format, which is processed and stored  in the MySQL database. 
Result Viewing: Students can log in using their unique student ID to view their results. 
Download: Students can download their results in PDF format for record purposes
Error Handling: The system manages scenarios where no results are available for a student ID  and shows an appropriate error message. 

5. Implementation Details: 
File Upload: The system utilizes $_FILES in PHP to upload Excel files. The uploaded file is  processed with the PhpSpreadsheet library to read data and insert it into the MySQL database. 
Database: The MySQL database stores student information like Student ID, Name, Semester,  Subjects, Total Marks, Percentage, and Class. 
User Interface: The view page to display the result shows student data in tabular form. Users can  enter their student ID and fetch corresponding result data. 
PDF Download: Once the result is fetched, students can download the result in the form of a PDF  by making use of a custom PHP script that creates the file. 

6. Challenges Faced: 
Data Validation: Validation of Excel data in proper format before processing and inserting into  database. 
Handling Large Files: Fine-tuning the system for handling big Excel files and making file uploads  seamless. 
User Interface: Crafting an uncomplicated yet efficient interface that enables hassle-free  interaction for both students and faculty. 

7. Conclusion: 
This project is an effective and user-friendly solution for the management of student results. The  system enables hassle-free upload, retrieval, and download of results. It is a useful tool for  institutions to manage and automate the process of result management. 

8. Future Scope: 
Including automated email notifications to students about the status of their results. Including authentication features for safe access to the system. 
Including a grading system to translate numeric marks into letter grades. 
This project was designed as a part of the academic course for the AI/ML stream at Maharaja  Agrasen Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Narinder Kaur.
